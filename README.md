# E-Commerce Matrix

## Overview

This project involves analyzing various aspects of an eCommerce business using a structured dataset that includes sales, customers, products, and order information. The analysis leverages SQL for data querying and Python for deeper insights and visualizations. The goal is to uncover trends, customer behavior, product performance, and other key metrics to inform business decisions.

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze various aspects of an eCommerce business. The analysis covers:

### Basic Queries
1. Unique cities where customers are located.
2. Number of orders placed in 2017.
3. Total sales per category.
4. Percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
5. Count the number of customers from each state. 

### Intermediate Queries
1. Number of orders per month in 2018.
2. Average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
3. Percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
4. Correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
5. Total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.

### Advanced Queries
1. Moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
2. Cumulative sales per month for each year.
3. Year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
4. Retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
5. Top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.

The project uses SQL for data querying and aggregation, while Python is used for deeper analysis and visualization of the results.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project has been downloaded from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset).
This dataset focuses on Target's operations in Brazil, covering 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. It includes detailed information on order status, pricing, payment and shipping performance, customer locations, product attributes, and customer reviews.

### Features
The data is available in 8 csv files:

- customers.csv
- sellers.csv
- order_items.csv
- geolocation.csv
- payments.csv
- orders.csv
- products.csv

**A seperate python script is developed to convert these csv files into SQL database format.**

## Prerequisites

- **SQL Database**: A running SQL database is required. The provided SQL script (`ecommerce.sql`) will set up the necessary tables.
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook to run analysis notebooks.
- **Pandas**: Import the pandas library for the viewing the dataframes.
- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is extensively used for visulaisation purpose.
